# AdventOfCode2021

## Day 1
C with goto only, no function calls, no loops, no multiple line if cases, upfront declarations only.

## Day 2
Limitation of not using else cases makes any non-trivial condition a mess. 

## Day 3
Giant label mess. Complex conditions and nested loops make whole code very hard to read. Upfront declarations make handling of variables confusing.

## Day 4
fscanf is a mess. It works in misterious ways. Half of the time went for this...

## Day 5
Surprisingly fscanf worked fine. Very easy. Part 2 was actually even easier than part 1.

## Day 6
Part 1 can be easily brute forced. Stack was too small for potential number of fish so a dynamic allocation was needed. Figured out how to handle errors in a nice way. Part 2 is instant if you use dynamic programming.
